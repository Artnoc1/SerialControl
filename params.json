{"name":"Serialcontrol","tagline":"Arduino Firmware for remote controlling of multiple Arduinos in a XBee peer2peer network","body":"SerialControl is a simple open source (GPL2) firmware for the Arduino platform, that allows to remote control Arduinos over a serial connection. The implemented protocol can be used in a XBee peer2peer network. Multiple Arduino modules can be addressed by an ID. The firmware wraps most IO commands of the Arduino language to make the output pins controllable through a serially attached computer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
